                    <h2>About SASH</h2>
                    <p>
                      SASH (Students Against Sexual Harassment) is a high school student-led club with an emphasis on the education of
                      sexual
                      harassment for youth. We believe that educating our fellow high schoolers about sexual harassment and its affects on
                      society will help lessen the amount sexual harassment in the future. According to a survey by Stop Street Harassment
                      in
                      2018, 81% of women and 43% of men experience some form of sexual harassment in their lifetime. This statistic is
                      higher
                      for people of marginalized communities. We hope to lower these statistics through educating students in high schools
                      across the country.
